## Supabase Storage Setup

### 1. Create Storage Bucket

The storage service will automatically create a bucket named `teacher-credentials` with:

- Private access (no public URLs)
- 10MB file size limit
- Restricted mime types

### 2. RLS Policies (Optional)

If you want to add Row Level Security policies:

```sql
-- Allow users to upload their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own credentials"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'teacher-credentials' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Allow users to view their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own credentials"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'teacher-credentials' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Allow admins to view all files
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all credentials"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'teacher-credentials' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

## Email Notifications

The system automatically sends email notifications:

1. **To Admins**: When a new verification request is submitted
2. **To Teachers**:
   - When request is approved (with teacher dashboard access)
   - When request is rejected (with reason and resubmission instructions)

## Security Considerations

1. Files are stored in a private bucket with signed URLs
2. Only authenticated users with verified emails can submit requests
3. File uploads are validated for type and size
4. Admin role required for approval/rejection endpoints
5. Users can only check their own verification status

## Error Handling

- Duplicate pending requests are prevented
- File upload errors are handled gracefully
- Invalid file types are rejected before upload
- Expired tokens return appropriate error messages
